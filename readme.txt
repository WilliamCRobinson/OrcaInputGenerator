Documentation for Orca Input Generator

William Robinson 2024

Project Overview:

The project involves creating a Python program that generates input files for the quantum chemistry software Orca. The
program is designed to handle multiple input configurations at once, each with different molecular geometries, charges,
and spin multiplicities. The program can do one calculation type and many geometries. Its not too inconvenient to set up
multiple config files for each of your calc types.

Project Structure:

1.	Input Generator Module (input_generator.py):
    o	Responsibility: Generates Orca input files based on provided molecular configurations and calculation
                        parameters.
        o	Methods:
            	load_template_file(template_path): Loads the template Orca input file.
            	set_molecular_charge(charge): Sets the molecular charge for the structure.
            	set_spin_multiplicity(multiplicity): Sets the spin multiplicity for the structure.
            	generate_input_file(molecular_config, calculation_params): Generates an Orca input file based on the
                                                                           given molecular configuration and calculation
                                                                           parameters.
            	save_input_file(output_path, input_content): Saves the generated input file to the specified output
                directory.


2.	Configuration Reader Module (config_reader.py):
    o	Responsibility: Reads the configuration file containing molecular configurations and calculation parameters.
        o	Methods:
            	load_config_file(file_path): Reads and parses the configuration file.
            	get_molecular_configurations(): Retrieves a dictionary of molecular configurations.
            	get_calculation_parameters(): Retrieves a dictionary of calculation parameters.

Dependencies:

    OS package for using OS dependent functionalities.

Notes:

    This script will generate input files that reference xyz files,so when you go to run your jobs, be sure that the
    xyz files are also present

    Adjust the template file and placeholders based on your specific Orca input file format and requirements.

    Ensure that the required files (template, XYZ files, configuration file) are present in the specified paths

    The template file can be adjusted with plaintext, but if you mess with the curly bracket terms, it WILL break things.

Using this python package:

Basically, dump all your geometries into the data directory, then set up a configuration file copy and paste all your
file names into there, specify the parameters and the program should write everything according to the template from
there. Adjust the template.orca file as necessary if all your calcs are gonna have the same block. Also feel free to add
stuff to the

1. make all your xyz files. or move them all to one directory and download using some wildcard commands
        ie "mv finishedjobs/*/*/*.xyz directory_of_xyzfiles"
        though if you do this be sure to remove .trj and gori files
2. put all them in the data directory in this python package.
3. set up config.ini with what type of calculation you would like to run on these geometries.
    planned script: generate an easily edited config.ini from a directory of xyz files.
4. Adjust the template.orca to your project needs and let it go.
4. run the python program.
5. Check the output directory for your new orca inputs, add in extra blocks as needed.
